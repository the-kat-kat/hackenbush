Kat: Hackenbush is a combinatorial game, a game played
between two players with a winning strategy.
Kook: The goal of the game is to be the last one who can make a viable move. 
Players alternate turns, breaking a stick of their color on their turn. 
Kat: If a stick is no longer connected to the ground in anyway, it will also break.
Kook: Let's look at a demo game between me at Kat
